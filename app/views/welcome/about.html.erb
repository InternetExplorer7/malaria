<p>Ebola killed 11,299. In 2015 alone, malaria killed <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/">438,000</a>.</p>

<p>We are a team of Harvard College undergraduates who recently won the Defeating Malaria Initiative's $10,000 prize to 
implement a project that raises awareness of malaria amongst young adults around the nation. 

<p>For our project, we plan to utilize the popular game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)">"Assassins"</a>
to improve knowledge about, and interest in, malaria amongst young adults. 
In April 2016, we will run a malaria-themed version of Assassins simultaneously on college campuses around the United States. 
Winners at each school will receive cash prizes, and the top 10 game organizers will be flown out to Harvard to be part of World Malaria day activities on campus.</p>

<p>While there have been great strides in malaria work and research in the past several years, malaria is not a solved problem. 
We hope to use our campaign to raise awareness and inspire young adults to spread the word and continue the fight to eradicate malaria.</p>
